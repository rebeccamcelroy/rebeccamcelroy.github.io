      <description>Science illustration combines my two passions. I started out doing simple drawings for talks and have recently been illustrating astronomical observatories. You can find my work on instagram, twitter, and even redbubble if you would like a sticker or mug.
On this site you can find my various illustrations, which are free for you to use with attribution. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Art has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I have always loved to draw and paint. Recently I have been drawing astronomical observatories, some of which are shown above. Want a drawing of your telescope? Shoot me an email or a DM on instagram or twitter.
I also do a lot of portaiture of characters from TV and video games, and make various stickers on redbubble.

      <description>Hello!!
I am a Research Fellow in the Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT. The Close AGN Reference Survey looks at local active galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum and I also work with the galaxy merger simulations to study how galaxy kinematics evolve as galaxies collide.
Previously, I was at the University of Queensland, the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, and the Max Plank Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.</description>

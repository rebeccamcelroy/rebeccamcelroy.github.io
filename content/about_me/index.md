Hello!!

I am a Research Fellow in the [Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.unisq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/iaess/centre-for-astrophysics) at the [University of Southern Queensland](https://www.unisq.edu.au/). I am based, however, in Sydney where I hold honorary appointments at the [University of Sydney](https://sifa.sydney.edu.au/) and [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/centres/astrophysics-and-space-technologies). Throughout the week you can usually find me at SIfA on Mondays, Macquarie on Fridays, and working from home the rest of the week. I'm usually on UniSQ campus once a month, so if you need to see me in person just let me know and we can coordinate.  

I work on how nearby galaxies evolve, focussing on several themes:
- How do the supermassive black holes that live in the centres of galaxies impact their hosts?
- How do these supermassive black holes evolve? How do they switch on and off?
- What happens to galaxies when they undergo collisions?
 
 I lead the [The Close AGN Reference Survey](https://cars-survey.github.io), which looks at local active galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum to address these questions. I am also co-chair of two of the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/) (Active Galaxy Science Collaboration)[https://agn.science.lsst.org/] sub-groups focussed on variability. I am a member of the [Sydney AAO Multi-object IFU (SAMI)](https://sami-survey.org/) and [Hector](https://hector.survey.org.au/) Galaxy Survey teams, which are Australian lead and run surveys of thousands of nearby galaxies conducted at the [Anglo-Australian Telescope](https://aat.anu.edu.au/front) in Coonabarabran, NSW. 

Previously, I was at the University of Queensland, the University of Sydney, and the Max Plank Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney on integral field spectroscopic observations of active galactic nuclei. The aim of my thesis was to investigate how supermassive black holes and the galaxies they live in interact and coevolve. I was supervised by Professor Scott Croom and worked with The SAMI Galaxy Survey and The Close AGN Reference Survey teams. Part of my thesis was focused on a serendipitously discovered two-time changing look active galaxy, which resulted in [multiple](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/09/16/_starving_-black-hole-returns-galaxy-mrk-1018-to-the-shadows.html) press releases.

I am passionate about astronomy and love to participate in teaching and outreach. I have 10 years teaching experience in Astronomy and Physics at the University of Sydney, University of Queensland, and University of Southern Queensland. Over this time I have been involved in course coordination, course material creation, lecturing and tutoring, and exam creation and marking.

Outside of academia I love to hang out with my cats, paint, and explore new places and cuisines!

Science illustration combines my two passions. I started out doing simple drawings for talks and have recently been illustrating astronomical observatories. You can find my work on [instagram](instagram.com/paintingbybex), [twitter](twitter.com/re_mcelroy), and even [redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/paintingbybex/shop) if you would like a sticker or mug. 

On [this site](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C8KAJDvMLDopVWPV1iUUh7cJ2aeBp6G4?usp=sharing) you can find my various illustrations, which are free for you to use with attribution. Enjoy!

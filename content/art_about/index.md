Art has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I have always loved to draw and paint. Recently I have been drawing astronomical observatories, some of which are shown above. Want a drawing of your telescope? Shoot me an [email](mailto:rebecca.mcelroy@unisq.edu.au) or a DM on [instagram](instagram.com/paintingbybex) or [twitter](twitter.com/re_mcelroy).

I also do a lot of portaiture of characters from TV and video games, and make various stickers on [redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/paintingbybex/shop). 

On [this site](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C8KAJDvMLDopVWPV1iUUh7cJ2aeBp6G4?usp=sharing) you can find my telescope illustrations and other science illustration scribbles, which are free for you to use with attribution. Enjoy!

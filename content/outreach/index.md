Need an astronomy expert? I do frequent outreach work in schools, pubs, on the radio, and occasionally even on TV. 

Shoot me an [email](mailto:rebecca.mcelroy@unisq.edu.au) or reach out on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/breaky.bsky.social) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-mcelroy/) and we can see what we can organise. I also have several fantastic students who love outreach and would love to be involved.

{{< person src="rebecca.jpeg" name="Dr Rebecca McElroy" role="Group Lead" email="rebecca.mcelroy@unisq.edu.au" >}}
Leads the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) investigating the physics of nearby active galaxies. Co-chair of the LSST AGN Science Collaboration’s Watchlist and Follow-up Working Groups, and member of the HECTOR team - an Australian next-generation integral-field spectrograph for galaxy evolution studies.

{{< person src="thomas.jpg" name="Thomas Dunn" role="Honours Student" >}}
Combining archival photographic plates with contemporary multi-wavelength observations to build a century-long light curve of the changing-look active galaxies Mrk 1018. His work bridges historical datasets with modern time-domain astronomy to trace accretion-rate evolution over decades.
